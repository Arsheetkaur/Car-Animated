## How It Works
1. The car remains stationary while the track moves
2. Wheels rotate independently
3. Background elements create parallax effect
4. Subtle shaking simulates engine vibration
5. Sound plays in loop (currently commented out)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in browser
3. Uncomment audio.play() in script.js to enable sound
